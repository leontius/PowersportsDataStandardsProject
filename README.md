PowersportsDataStandardsProject
===============================

The Powersports Data Standards Project (PDS) is a joint initiative from some of the leading Powersports
Original Equipment (OE) manufacturers to develop integration interfaces between Powersports Dealer Management 
System applications (DMS) and the OE business systems that support the dealers.  The interfaces are based on open data standards from STAR (Standards for Technology in Automotive Retail), 
open transport standards using REST, and open security standards using OAuth.  

In the spirit of open standards, the OE manufacturers participating in the PDS initiative have established this 
GitHub repository to enable the sharing of development artifacts that they generate as they develop their integration
interfaces.
